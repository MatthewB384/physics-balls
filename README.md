# physics-balls
A first attempt at a physics simulation using balls that collide with one another
This is not bug free but it's good enough for my first attempt as a physics simulation.

BEFORE USING:

1) Scroll to the bottom to #Settings.

2) px_dims is the dimensions in pixels of the display it will create. Adjust this so that the 2 values are in the ratio of your monitor's display size. Go with a height of between 100 and 120 pixels.

3) sc_dims is the number of rows by the number of columns of the output display when printed. This should be the number of rows by the number of columns of your terminal or shell window. It's ok if it's a little bit smaller, but adjust it if it is too big or things will start to look funky.

4) Fps is the framerate of the display. Make your fps should be as high as possible without causing the animation to slow down. A high fps also gives a more accurate animation.

line 94 is fun
